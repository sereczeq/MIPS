# polynomial
# Please write a program calculating the value of the third degree polynomial for the given parameters a, b, c, d and x. The form of a polynomial: y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d.

# From: y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d
# given: a, b, c, d, x
# result: y

# $t0 will store the result y
# $t1 will store the x value
# $t2 - $t5 will store a, b, c, d
